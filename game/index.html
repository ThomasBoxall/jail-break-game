        <h2>Cell</h2>
        <p>You enter your cell and see a single bed with an iron frame, a small desk, and a toilet and sink at the other end of the cell. The small window above the bed has bars on them.</p>
        <a class="buttonLink" href="#aaaa">Look out the Window</a>
        <a class="buttonLink" href="#aabh">Look at the bed</a>
        <a class="buttonLink" href="#aagh">Start writing your escape plan</a>
        <a class="buttonLink" href="#aabo">Go try to explore</a>

    <div id="aaaa">
        <h2>Look out the window</h2>
        <p>You see that there is a small dock with a small boat that isn't guarded. You know how you'll be able to get off the island since you've spent all your summers sailing </p>
        <a class="buttonLink" href="#aads">Go back</a>
    </div>
    <div id="aabh">
        <h2>Look at the bed</h2>
        <p>Looks really uncomfortable, you need to escape this place and return to your nice soft bed!</p>
        <a class="buttonLink" href="#aads">Go back</a>
    </div>
    <div id="aagh">
        <h2>Start writing your escape plan</h2>
        <p>The guard enters the room and finds you writing your escape plan. It is confiscated and you're sent to solitary confinementâ€¦congrats you've set a new record for the fastest time for a new inmate to be sent to the hole and you fail your escape mission, start over!! </p>
        <a class="buttonLink" href="#aads">Go back</a>
    </div>
    <div id="aabo">
        <h2>Go try to explore</h2>
        <p>Well done. This is the correct option. Once you continue you can't return here. You might want to look at other options in case they're useful.</p>
        <a class="buttonLink" href="#aads">Go back</a>
