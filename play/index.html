    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>You've been arrested for burglary of the crown jewels :( The judge has sent you to a prison off the coast of Portsmouth to make an example of you. You decide that you will escape, but you need to be quick in your plan while the prison updates its security.</p>
    <p>As you make your way through the prison you will be given options to interact with the scenario. Some options will give you information or items to help you in your plan to escape, and others will send you back to the beginning. If you are ready to move to the next room then you can press that option but you will not be able to revisit the previous room unless you restart. Good Luck!</p>
    <p>Oh, I didn't mention, some options will make your life harder and some will make your life easier. Choose wisely! </p>
